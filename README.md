# conditional-statement
Controlling processes
Decision-making is as important in any programming language as it is in life. Decision-making in a programming language is automated using conditional statements, in which Python evaluates the code to see if it meets the specified conditions.

The conditions are evaluated and processed as true or false. If this is found to be true, the program is run as needed. If the condition is found to be false, the statement following the If condition is executed.
